This is a fork of the work of the gant project
(http://cgit.get-open.com/cgit.cgi/gant/), which includes a number of
fixes for stability and correctness. This has been tested on 32-bit
and 64-bit machines for connecting to a Garmin 405.

Please send patches to wbell@cs.cornell.edu; I'll attempt to get them
upstream.

=== Original README ===

Test version of 405 download
Needs lots of work!

Usage:

Put 405 in pairing mode
./gant -f paul -a auth405

This gives your garmin a name of "paul" and an auth file of "auth405"
The 405 will ask you if you wish to pair with "paul". Obviously
you might want to use a different name :)

Download with:
./gant -nza auth405 > output

or -Dnza if you want lots of debug output

It doesn't seem to be very reliable at starting the download and
I haven't investigated why yet. So, if it doesn't start downloading
press ctrl-c and try again. I find it helps to take the watch out
of power save mode.

If you've already downloaded the data, then you'll need to set
"force send" to yes on the watch.

Compare output with .TCX file produce by windows ANT Agent.
